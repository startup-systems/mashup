My project is a web page that could according to the entered keywords, dynamically return related Wikipedia result.

The page would dynamic load and display result without actions like click or press enter. When keywords changes, it would clean and fetch new data.

You need to have a Google knowledge-graph API key to run it, I have my API key in index.html for demo (I know I should not do that, after I got grade for this homework, I will destroy this key on google for sure.)
