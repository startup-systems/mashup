This is the code for my personal homepage, which uses index.html, stylesheet.css and scripts.js to display all the contents.<br>
<li>In this code, I have displayed information about my name, a photo, NetID and a brief description about me, and styled them using basic css.</li>
<li>I have used javascript to enable touch on the image, and have written a javascript function to expand the image along with the caption when clicked on.</li><li>Along with this, I've also added a section to display the top tracks of my favorite artist Metallica using the Spotify API and done this using an ajax call. This also shows the preview of the song, and the album cover in a table.</li><li>Each album cover is also clickable, which then expands in the same way as the main image.</li>
