# Mashup project

Used Mapbox.js API and Yahoo weather API for thie mashup project. The page will show the current weather at NYC and suggesting you to explore the restaurants at NYC. Then I added geojson file with information related to restaurants I like. Click the markers on the map will return information about that place.

Used bootstrap for quick styling and responsive design.
