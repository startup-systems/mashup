# Mashup Project

My API mashup project uses the Wunderground and MapBox API to alert the user of the temperature at a selected location on the map.

To use, click anywhere on the map in the United States and an alert will show up notifying you of the city, state, and the "Feels Like" and "Actual" temperatures in Farhenheit of the location you selected.

Note* while the instructions say to not include the api keys, my project does. Both of my api keys were created using free accounts and are not exploitable.
