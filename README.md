# Google Map - Whois Mashup

## Description
A mashup project that shows the the geolocation on Google Map based on visitor's WHOIS record.
It mashes up the outputs from two APIs:
1. GPS coordinates in your IPWHOIS record (API by ip-api.com/)
2. Visualize the GPS coordinates in a Google Map (API by maps.googleapis.com)

## Notes
(For Chrome) Please click on "Load the unsafe scripts butter" if see the warning "This page is trying to load scripts from unauthenticated sources."

It is just schoolwork. I do not track your location. Feel free to inspect my source code.
