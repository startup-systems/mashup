# Mashup project

Mashup of Google Directions API + OpenWeatherMap API

Hey New Yorkers! Have you ever wanted to go to central park for a walk but were unsure of the weather? Tired of going to a site to search for weather? This site abstracts out that second step so that you can directly get the weather of Central Park and directions to it.

(Provides users with weather forecast and directions to central park, loops through direction data to add ebonics to it.)
